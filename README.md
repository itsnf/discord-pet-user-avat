To use the bot, you need to create a `config.json` file in the root of the project. Here is an example

```json
{
    "token": "Youre.Bot.token-here",
    "guildId": [
        "Guild-id-where-you-will-use-this-bot-#1",
        "Guild-id-where-you-will-use-this-bot-#2",
        "Guild-id-where-you-will-use-this-bot-#3"
    ],
    "clientId": "Your-bot-id"
}
```

After configuring the config and adding the bot to the server you need to run `deploy-commands.bat` and after `start.bat`. And that's it!
